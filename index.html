          some happy little clouds in our world. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. There comes a nice
          little fluffer.</p>
        <p>We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to
          painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. This is
          your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Let's put some highlights on these little
          trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky.</p>
        <p>If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. Every day I learn. We can fix anything. We have
          no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination.</p>

  What's needed?
  ==============

  1. Functions that will hide and show the terms content
  2. Function that will toggle the aria-expanded attribute AND the visibility of the content
  3. Event Listeners on the buttons that will trigger the toggle function on click, spacebar, and on return.
  4. Event handlers that will trigger the correct functions
*/

// #1 Set Up functions that will toggle the expansion of the content
const showContent = contentElement => (contentElement.style.display = `block`);
const hideContent = contentElement => (contentElement.style.display = `none`);
const toggleExpand = (toggleButton, contentElement) => {
  if (toggleButton.getAttribute('aria-expanded') === 'true') {
    toggleButton.setAttribute('aria-expanded', 'false');
    hideContent(contentElement);
  } else {
    toggleButton.setAttribute('aria-expanded', 'true');
    showContent(contentElement);
  }
};

// #2 Select the terms button and the content it is controlling
const termsButton = document.querySelector('#terms-button');
const termsContentId = termsButton.getAttribute('aria-controls');
const termsContent = document.getElementById(termsContentId);

// #3 Create the needed event handlers
const handleClick = event => {
  toggleExpand(termsButton, termsContent);
  event.stopPropagation();
  event.preventDefault();
};

const handleKeydown = event => {
  switch (event.code) {
    case 'Space':
    case 'Enter':
      toggleExpand(termsButton, termsContent);
      event.stopPropagation();
      event.preventDefault();
      break;
    default:
      break;
  }
};

// #4 Add the click and keydown event handlers
termsButton.addEventListener('click', handleClick);
termsButton.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeydown);
